// If you reach here means you're reviewing my Codes! Amazing!!

// Challenge Reflection

// I thoroughly enjoyed working on this frontend project for Awesomity. The design was impressive, and implementing the UI was both challenging and rewarding.

// During the development process, I encountered some challenges with the Swagger API endpoints. Specifically, I faced issues with sign-in functionality for
// non-seller roles, where no token was provided, preventing user info review. For the buyer role, while the API provided all necessary data,
// I couldnâ€™t complete the login due to the isActive flag being set to false. This might indicate that buyers require additional privileges to log in
//  or perform actions like adding or retrieving products.

// I also worked diligently to match the Figma design as closely as possible and conducted testing on various components and pages. Despite the tight deadline,
// I put my best effort into delivering the project.

// Thank you for the opportunity to work on this challenge!
